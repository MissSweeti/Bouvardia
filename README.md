## Installing

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open index.html up in a web browser.

3. Profit!


## Using the .hta file

Using the hta file is **very** alpha and not for the faint of heart.

But, if you'd like to try it anyway, you can download the file [https://raw.github.com/TDLive-Inc/Bouvardia/gh-pages/bouvardia.hta](here).

## Making your own games

Take a look at the source of game.js. Most to all of the config. options are there.

## Demo

I thought you would never ask! http://bouvardia.taurus.pw/
